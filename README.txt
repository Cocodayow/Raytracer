This is a basic raytracer implementation.

Implemented some parts of the bounded volume algorithm. Created boundingbox structures for triangles and spheres,
then test if the ray intersects with any of those boundingboxes, if it intersects then we further test the intersection of the ray
with the object, otherwise we move on to the next object. 

Sadly, don't get it to work right now, still developing!
